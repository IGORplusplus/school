1. The program shifts the number to the right by the significant amount of times (32) and gets added back
to the left most bits that get shifted over out of significance. The left most bits get shifted over to the right
to where they would be (32 - shiftamount).

    shift %= 32;

    return source << shift | source >> (32 - shift);


2. If the shift amount is 0 nothing should happen, if the number is to bitshifted left 31 times it should
be bitwise shifted right.

3. Bits wrap are automatically wrapped around the number through the algorithm.

4. The bit shift left, bit shift right, and the bitwise or operation
