OVERVIEW
Sed goes through files line by line editing them in that way
these lines are edited in the pattern space

STDIN -> SCRIPT -> STDOUT
  |         |        |
  V         V        V
  input   outputs  output


SED SCRIPTS


FLAGS
-r makes sed recognize (), [], *, + as they should be
-e inline script

N append next line to current one
q quit
a for append (sed '5a\Extra line here' file.txt


EXAMPLES

s/Warren Buffet/W. Buffet/    Substitute W. Buffet for the first occurrence of Warren Buffet in pattern space
s/Four/Five/2      Substitutes Five for the second occurrence of Four in the pattern space (i.e., each line)
s/paper/plastic/p      Substitutes plastic for the first occurrence of paper and outputs (prints) pattern space


Substitute can use several special characters in the replacement string
